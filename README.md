# 🎮 Reaction Time Game

A simple browser-based game to measure and track your **reaction speed**.  
The game randomly displays shapes on the screen, and you must click them as fast as possible.  
It records your best time, total play time, and even keeps track of your **weekly play time** using `localStorage`.
